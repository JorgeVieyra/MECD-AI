CODE:
- Added an interface using pygame with menus that enable the interaction with the user
- Made a playable mode where the user can solve the puzzles by interacting with the program
- Implemented 2 more Informed Search algorithms:
    - A*
    - Weighted A*
- Changed Heuristic 1 from returning the distance of pieces of the same colour to returning the number of incorrect placed pieces
- Updated greedy search, where it no longer uses 2 functions but only one for both heuristics, it also works better overall, always reaching a solution, what was not the case before.

PRESENTATION:
- Changed the Greedy Search slide to suit the changes done to the code
- Added a slide relative to the A* algorithm implementation and another for the Weighted A* one
- Changed Heuristics slide to suit the changes done to Heuristic 1
- Changed tables of each puzzle on Evaluation of Results to include the new algorithms and the changed Greedy Search one, with the use of the new heuristic
- Changed some minor things on Conclusion and Informed Search slides
